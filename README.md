## Installation

This is an alpha pre-release package not available on CRAN. To install it, you need to get it from here (github).

Please note that this package may not work very well on Windows. It is developed and tested on Linux, and probably works on Mac.

To make things easier, use the `install_github()` function from the `devtools` package.

install.packages("devtools")
