# seqManagement

seqManagement is a collection of tools to help manipulate and format alignment files to be used for phylogenetic analyses.

## Installation

This is an alpha pre-release package not available on CRAN. There is limited testing, function names can change, and it's full of bugs (maybe). To install it, you need to get it from here (github).

Please note that this package may not work very well on Windows. It is developed and tested on Linux, and probably works on Mac.

To make things easier, use the `install_github()` function from the `devtools` package.

````
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("fmichonneau/seqManagement")
````

More details soon.
